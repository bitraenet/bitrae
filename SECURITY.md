## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security issues send an email to crypto@bitrae.net (not for support).

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name | Fingerprint |
|------|-------------|
| Bitraedev | 1A191F2DD1E5F55C8A919E3430A671BB4F6E51F6

You can import a key by running the following command with that individualâ€™s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints containing spaces.
